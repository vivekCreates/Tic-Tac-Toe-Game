This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
3. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.
